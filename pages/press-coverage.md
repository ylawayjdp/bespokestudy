# Press coverage

Bespoke has attracted significant interest from the press, including ITV London, The Evening Standard, The Times and Road.cc. Representatives from London Cycling Campaign and CTC have attended our events and published subsequent articles. Jon Snow and Alex Dowsett have publicly expressed their on-going support for the project. In addition, the project has generated constructive debate and discussion within the cycling community and on social media forums. A Bespoke public engagement meeting took place on 7th October 2014.
