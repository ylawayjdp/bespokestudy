# What is the Bespoke Study?

The Bespoke project is a collaboration between the research teams of the Orthopaedic and Emergency Departments of Barts Health NHS Trust, and with Barts Charity to explore bicycle related injuries in London. As researchers, we are committed to an entirely agnostic and neutral approach, allowing for the provision of accurate and unbiased evidence and informed decision-making by transport planners, local councils and healthcare policymakers. As people who ride bicycles, our ultimate aim is to make cycling in London safer for all.
