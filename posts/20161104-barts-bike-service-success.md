# Barts

Over the last couple of months we have supported several free bike servicing events at Whipps Cross Hospital, Barts Hospital and Newham Hospital for all Barts Staff. This was organised by the Barts Sustainability team, and we had an excellent mechanic from Dr Bike sorting out all sorts of bike problems as well as completing secure bike marking for Barts Staff. We wanted to get out to as many sites as possible- to ensure everyone had a chance to get their bike ready for winter cycling!
