# Bespoke study partners collideosco.pe (@Collideoscp) receive funding from DFT

> From time to time the Bespoke Study team will host posts by our collaborators. One of the vital relationships the Bespoke study team has is with [Ben ](https://twitter.com/BenJam)and [Neil ](https://twitter.com/NG2_Neil)from [www.collideosco.pe](http://www.collideosco.pe) . Their project which is a central part of the Bespoke study has gone from strength to strength. So it was great to hear that they have been successful in a competition for research funding from the Department for Transport. Here's more from the collideosco.pe [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/collideoscope?fref=ts) post on the project.
