# Start cycling!

In response to a lack of physical activity in the UK, Public Health England have developed [The Physical Activity tool](http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/physical-activity). This combines data of physical activity and related risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. The tool compares local data to national data to develop better understanding and therefore promotion of physical activity, such as walking and cycling.
