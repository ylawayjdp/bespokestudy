# NipNip Bike Service Success!!!

We hosted our NipNip FREE bike servicing afternoon on Wednesday, which was a huge success! One of the talented NipNip bike mechanics serviced bikes from 3-7pm outside the Royal London Hospital, managing to service 40 bikes in total â€“ an incredible 10 per hour! We were really encouraged by the amount of cyclists turning out to ensure their bikes were road safe. We also had The Met police attending to complete bike markings to aid bike security. The Leigh Day Cycling Team were also here to help, and share their cycling knowledge with fellow cyclists which was an added bonus!
