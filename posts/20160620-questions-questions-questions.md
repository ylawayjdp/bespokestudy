# Questions, questions, questions..

We have had lots of queries regarding how our questions were formulated and exactly what we are asking of the cyclists in The Bespoke Study. Our research approach is committed to being questioning and neutral in order to allow for unbiased evidence to be collected. There are some amazing benefits from cycling and as health care professionals we are keen to promote it across the UK; the ultimate aim of the study is to make London roads safer for all cyclists.
