# Bespoke Team wins Health Hero award

Following a fairly quiet, wintery January, this week saw the arrival of the much anticipated Barts Health Heroes awards evening. The Barts Health Heroes awards were launched on 1 October 2012 as an opportunity to reward and recognise those staff who demonstrate the values of Barts Health in their daily working lives and create a culture where the values become central to all that they do. This year there were 517 nominations receivedâ€“ 392 for individuals and 125 for teams who embody [Barts Health values ](http://www.bartshealth.nhs.uk/about-us/our-values/)in their day to day work.
